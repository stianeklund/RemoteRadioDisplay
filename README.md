A WIP display for showing frequency etc from CAT data.

Runs on a Sunton ESP32S3-8048-S050C a 5" 800x480 IPS capacitive touch display with a ESP32-S3 MCU.

* GUI created through Squareline.
* This project uses ESP-IDF and not Arduino.


There are some modifications from the example code that comes with this device as some of the pin configuration is wrong.

Note this project currently does _nothing_ it just displays a mockup / WIP GUI design on the display.
